## web-scraping.dev

Some basic scraping project using [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) Library and [web-scraping.dev](https://web-scraping.dev/) site.  
It can be run using `scrapy crawl products` to scrapy all pages, but if you want the output in a file, then run `scrapy crawl products -o {file_name}.{file_extension}`
